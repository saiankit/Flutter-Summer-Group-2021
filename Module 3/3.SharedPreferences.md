You can store data in a database like PostgresSQL, MongoDB, etc. But you can also use your Phone Storage as a database. We can store data as a relational database / non-relational database ( but we can get to know about them in the latter part of the course ). 
We can also store some small data inside the phone storage using Shared Preferences.
Suppose you want to save a small value (a flag probably) that you want to reference later when a user launches the application. Then shared preference comes into action.

They are used to store key-value pairs. We can store data something like this.
```
userID = 2019AAPS0331H
userName = Sai Ankit
```
