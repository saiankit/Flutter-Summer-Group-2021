I assume you are familiar now with static user interface widgets in Flutter which are the below listed
1. Row
2. Column
3. Stack
4. Expanded
5. Container
6. SizedBox
7. Button
8. Text
9. Image

Now, it's the time to get your hands dirty with some dynamic User Interface widgets like

I am also introducing you to the most valuable resource for learning advanced Flutter concepts from Google Devs
### [The Boring Flutter Development Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr8F2S3Amas&list=PLjxrf2q8roU3ahJVrSgAnPjzkpGmL9Czl&index=59)
This is generally on a higher side of the Flutter, where the google Devs discuss how to fix some errors while you code. It is a live code with the Google Devs series, and it is pretty good to watch. Without overwhelming much, go ahead and watch the Pilot episode of Boring show. I assure you it won't be boring.
