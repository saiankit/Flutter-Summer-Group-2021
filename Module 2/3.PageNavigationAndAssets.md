#### Page Navigation in Flutter
Page Navigation in Flutter is a cakewalk.
Follow on with this [link](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/navigation/navigation-basics) to understand how to navigate between screens in Flutter. 

Also recommended to go through this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlArCl8jvlo) for Navigation
( Screens are nothing but Widgets itself xD )

#### Using Assets
Assets are nothing but images, svg icons or custom fonts you want to use in your application for a custom feel.

Your goto [document ](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images).


#### Very Important
Two main issues you might have for the assets not loading properly
1. Not properly indeting the pubspec.yaml file ( yaml files are very very strict in terms of indentation )
2. Stop the app, and run again for the assets to load properly.
